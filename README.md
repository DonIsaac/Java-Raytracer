# Java Raytracer
A simple 3D raytracer in Java. 

##NOTE##
This program is not complete! It works partially, but is missing many features and optimizations, along with incomplete javadoc comments.

##So How Does it Work?##
You can check the github wiki for descriptions for how this program works. It is a work in progress, done in my free time, so it may be imperfect and incomplete.
